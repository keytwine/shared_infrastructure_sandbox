Shared Infrastructure for Sandbox
---------------------------------

Shared infrastructure for tests in Sandbox, specially on AWS

It configures stuff like DNS, buckets, etc for tests and experiments.

For example:

 * Shared buckets for cloudfoundry and bosh
 * Shared DNS names for CF, shared certificates...
